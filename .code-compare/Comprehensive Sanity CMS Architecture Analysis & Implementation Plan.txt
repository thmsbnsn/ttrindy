Comprehensive Sanity CMS Architecture Analysis & Implementation Plan
I've analyzed your Top Tier Restoration website and created a complete, production-ready Sanity architecture that will make the entire site editable by non-technical users.
🎯 Current State Analysis
Your site currently has:

✅ Already Editable: Projects, Blog Posts, Categories
❌ Hardcoded: Navigation, Footer, Hero sections, Service cards, Stats, Values, Contact info, SEO settings, Call-to-action sections

🏗️ Complete Sanity Schema Architecture
I'll provide a fully normalized, scalable schema with:

Singleton Documents for unique pages (Home, About, Services)
Reusable Content Blocks for flexible page building
Global Settings for site-wide content
Enhanced SEO on all documents
Type-safe TypeScript schemas
