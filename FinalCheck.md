THE ULTIMATE WEBSITE COMPLETENESS CHECKLIST
(If you check all of these, your site is definitely ready.)

⭐ 1. CORE FUNCTIONALITY CHECK (Must Pass All)
Your website is ready only if:
✔ All buttons work
✔ Contact forms send properly & you receive emails
✔ Phone numbers are clickable on mobile
✔ Google Maps links open correctly
✔ All menu links function
✔ No broken images, missing sections, or placeholder text
✔ Page speeds load in under ~2.5 seconds
If every click works and nothing is broken → you're good.

⭐ 2. CONVERSION-READY CHECK
(This is the part 99% of restoration websites fail.)
Your website is ready to start bringing in leads if:
✔ There is a 24/7 emergency call button visible at all times
✔ Your main CTA repeats across pages (ex: “Get a Free Quote”)
✔ Homepage explains what you do in 5 seconds
✔ You have trust elements:
Licensed & insured
Years of experience
Homes restored

Testimonials (or at least badges)
✔ Clear service area listed
✔ Easy to contact with phone, form, email, and emergency CTA
✔ Each service page explains:
The problem
The solution
What you do
Why you’re the right company
How to get started
If these are in place → the site can convert real homeowners.

⭐ 3. CONTENT & BRAND CONSISTENCY CHECK
The website is ready if your copy:

✔ Sounds the same across every page
✔ Has the same tone & professional style
✔ Doesn’t contradict itself
✔ Has no spelling or grammar errors
✔ Uses consistent formatting (headings, spacing, icons, colors)
Since we rewrote everything to sound unified → you’re already close.

⭐ 4. SE0-READY CHECK
(You don't need to be perfect — just not hurting yourself.)
Website is ready for search engines if:
✔ Page titles and meta descriptions exist for main pages
✔ Each service page uses keywords naturally
✔ Image alt text is filled out
✔ H1/H2 structure is clean
✔ Location-based keywords appear (Indianapolis, etc.)
✔ URLs are clean and simple
✔ Business name + phone number appear in footer
You don’t need advanced SEO yet — but basic must be done.

⭐ 5. Mobile Optimization Check
Your website is ready for launch if mobile:
✔ Looks clean and readable
✔ Buttons are easy to tap
✔ Text isn’t too small
✔ No elements overlap
✔ Contact button is sticky or easy to access
✔ Forms are easy to fill out
Over 70% of restoration leads come from mobile

⭐ 6. Legal & Business Completeness
✔ Privacy Policy page
✔ Terms of Service
✔ Email connected to a proper business inbox
✔ Phone number is real and tested
✔ Logo is correct
✔ License info is present
✔ Emergency hours clearly shown

⭐ 7. Final Quality Check — Ask Yourself These Questions
If you can confidently answer YES to all of these, the website is ready:
1. Can a homeowner tell what we do in under 3 seconds?
2. Can someone contact us in ONE click?
3. Does the site make us look professional and trustworthy?
4. Would YOU hire this company if you were a stranger?
5. Does every page have a purpose and a clear next step?
6. Can an insurance adjuster, homeowner, or realtor understand the services immediately?
7. Does it look good on both desktop AND mobile?
If ALL answers = yes → your site is 100% ready to launch.

⭐ BONUS: The “Stranger Test”
Ask someone unfamiliar with restoration to look at it for 10 seconds and ask:
“What does this business do and how do you contact them?”
If they get it instantly → it’s launch-ready.
